## Wann war nochmal Kolloquium??
In university, every week like clockwork, there were at least 5 people across multiple whatsapp group-chats were asking when the next colloquium is scheduled and which zoom link is the currently active. To solve this issue, I&apos;ve built a small web-app that lists all upcoming colloquia, including the active zoom link and schedule pdf.

## Setup
Simple static site generator build on ejs (Embedded JavaScript templating). It generates a tabular overview of the upcoming colloquia with the correct current zoom links etc. Schedule is supplied as CSV file. Has not been updated for a while.

## Result
