## Background
For a client from the medical field, we built a new division on the website ("Neue Gesundheitskultur"). As part of this, an interactive navigation for the entire division was to be developed to facilitate the exploration of the individual topics and to make it as appealing and interactive as possible. This was to be integrated into the existing wordpress backend.

## Setup
- Rest API of the existing wordpress backend
- Custom plugin to deliver the bundled react app
- Custom plugin to control the layout and design of the mindmap navigation through the wordpress backend
- The mindmap itself as react app

## Result
