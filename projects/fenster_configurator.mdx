## Background
Build a window ecommerce shop for a local window contractor with a configurator, similar to <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://fenstermaxx24.de">fenstermaxx24.de</a> etc. Special request: generate correctly scaled sketch dynamically, similar to internal ordering software. A set of complex constraints regarding the dimensions of the windows need to be validated. This project is split in two: the react app, that generates the sketch and a ecommerce store, built with woocommerce. Both need to be tightly integrated. Here, i focus on the sketch, as the store is not public yet.

## Setup
- Integration into wordpress via custom plugin, loading the bundled app
- React App

## Result

<br />

- All sketches are entirely dynamically generated svg elements
- Memoized, >100 sketches displayable without noticable performance impact
- Client-side validation for opening directions and dimensions with arbitrary constraints
- Transfer of the sketch into the Woocommerce order process
- At the time of development the first configurator on the market to offer this functionality
