## Background
Build a small js library to anonymously log interactions on a website in a database for further analyses. Also build a small dashboard to quickly get an overview of the recorded interactions and export them to csv. Everything is hosted locally on a raspberry pi, available through the internet via dynDNS.

## Setup
- nginx as gateway and reverse proxy
- dynDNS
- mongoDB
- nodejs + express as server
- Small js script bundled with the website
- React App Dashboard
- Runs locally on a raspberry pi

## Result
Sadly, the project and raspberry are no more. As it was all installed locally, no screenshots can be made currently to show off the dashboard etc.
