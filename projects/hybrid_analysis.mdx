## Abstract
>Madagascar is one of the worlds hotspots for biodiversity, but despite major conservation efforts many of its ecosystems have been degraded and fragmented. Hybrid zones might provide a model for evolutionary processes, accelerated by anthropogenic effects, possibly improving the understanding of speciation and distribution of species and informing conservation management strategies. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are primates endemic to Madagascar, two hybridizing species of which (M. griseorufus and M. murinus) are the subject of this study. I re-assess a hybrid zone in southeastern Madagascar, within the region of Mangatsiaka, where the preferred habitats of both species border each other sharply, forming a contact zone. Using mitochondrial DNA (HV1 regioin) sequences and nine microsatellite markers, I performed population genetic analyses on 45 samples from 2017 and compared the results with analyses conducted on 159 samples from 2011 by [Hapke et al., 2011]. Bayesian clustering methods confirmed the continued existence of hybrids in the study area, while the proportions of individuals from both parental species present in the hybrid zone has changed significantly. This shift is likely influenced by environmental factors, but at present the dynamics underlying the hybrid zone remain inconclusive. This study highlights the importance of conducting further genetic and long-term ecological assessment of the population in Mangatsiaka in order to gain a better understanding of the factors driving the maintenance of this lemur hybrid zone.

## tl;dr
For my bachelor&apos;s degree, I extracted and sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from two species of mouse lemours (_M. griseorufus_ and _M. murinus_) and checked if they <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)">hybridized</a> when they met at a contact zone. Using <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite">microsatellites</a>, I concluded they were, but it was later revealed through RADseq that they probably didn&apos;t.

## Analysis
For the analysis, I used a combination of specialized bioinformatic tools and a lot of R for the population genetics analysis and subsequent plotting.

## Result
I received my degree with a very nice grade on it! (And produced some scientific insights, see tl;dr)

## Publication
The re-analysis with the RADseq data and some of my data were the basis for a manuscript, which is now accepted in Proceedings of the Royal Society B! ðŸŽ‰ It even contains one of my original figures.
