## Background
Developing wordpress websites for local businesses is how we started and is still the "bread and butter". We&apos;ve had clients across a wide range of industries, like <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://berufseinstieg-bundeswehr.de/">insurance</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://newport-optik.de/">opticians</a> and <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://qmb-dienstleistungen.de/">quality control</a>. For most, the service was not limited to the website, but included consultation for marketing (social media, google my business, and also some more <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BznaTy3oHJB/">hands-on support</a>) and organizing some related services (like physical marketing materials or photo shootings), as it was, more often than not, the first foray into online marketing.

## Setup
The sites are build using the divi site builder for wordpress. It allows for quick iteration on the design and, in combination with the wordpress plugin ecosystem, provides out-of-the-box solutions for almost all common use-cases. Many clients also required some form of custom solution for their specific use case, like <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://dr-wiechert.com/category/newsletter/">migrating a newsletter archive </a> and automatically publish new releases or <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://berufseinstieg-bundeswehr.de/#calculator-section">calculating insurance rates</a>.

## Result
Have a look at the links here to see some of the sites that are currently online. Overall, we&apos;ve completed more than 15 websites projects like these.
