## Setup
This site is build using nextJS, with threejs/react-three-fiber for the fancy 3d view and animations on the homepage. The projects from the portfolio (like this one) are statically generated from MDX (markdown with JSX components) using next-mdx-remote. No UI library was used, just pure css and css modules. Zustand is used to bridge the state between  canvas and DOM.
