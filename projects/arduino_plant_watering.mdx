## Setup
- Arduino Uno
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- 1 Channel 5V Relay Module
- Mini Water Pumps

## How it works
The arduino triggers the pumps via the relay depending on the moisture levels detected in the soil, watering the plants when the soil has become sufficiently dry. Alternatively, a schedule can be set to water the plants, independent of moisture levels.
