## Background
This was an experiment to try the serverless approach using firebase (backend-as-a-service offering by google) for authentication and their "real-time" nosql database instead of a custom backend. The real-time database synchronizes the database state instantly between clients, removing the need for custom synchronization and caching. To test this, a simple web-app was build that implements some common use-cases. This includes email/password+OAuth login and a simple task list that is synchronized between clients.

## Setup
- Firebase SDK (auth + database)
- React App
- Deployed on Netlify
